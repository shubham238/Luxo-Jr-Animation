# UpperBodyRepositioning
This project was implemented as part of a large scale project in collaboration with different
universities aimed at developing human computational models which could be further
used for studying impact on human body in different failure and crash scenarios.

This particular part implements various algorithms designed for repositioning thorax and lumbar part along with organs of upper human
body from one posture to another (standing, seated and supine) for different models of human body (.off format) in C++.
